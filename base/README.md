#jprjr/ubuntu-base:14.04

This is just my base for some upcoming images. For details on the high-level/artistic decisions, take a look at my [stack's readme](https://github.com/jprjr/docker-ubuntu-stack/blob/master/README.md)

It's based on the stock `ubuntu` image, w/ `s6` and `logstash-forwarder`
installed.
